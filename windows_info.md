The file system used in modern versions of  Windows  is the New Technology File System or simply  NTFS .

Before NTFS, there was  FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and HPFS (High Performance File System). 

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.   

### NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

    Supports files larger than 4GB
    Set specific permissions on folders and files
    Folder and file compression
    Encryption ( Encryption File System or EFS )


On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.
The permissions are:

    Full control
    Modify
    Read & Execute
    List folder contents
    Read
    Write


## How can you view the permissions for a file or folder?

    Right-click the file or folder you want to check for permissions.
    From the context menu, select Properties .
    Within Properties, click on the Security tab.
    In the Group or user names list, select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view.
