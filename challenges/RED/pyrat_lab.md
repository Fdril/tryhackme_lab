# Red
# PYrat

Pyrat receives a curious response from an HTTP server, which leads to a potential Python code execution vulnerability. With a cleverly crafted payload, it is possible to gain a shell on the machine. Delving into the directories, the author uncovers a well-known folder that provides a user with access to credentials. A subsequent exploration yields valuable insights into the application‚Äôs older version. Exploring possible endpoints using a custom script, the user can discover a special endpoint and ingeniously expand their exploration by fuzzing passwords. The script unveils a password, ultimately granting access to the root.

1. SUdo 
Runs the command with administrator/root privileges.
Nmap needs root for certain scans (like some scripts, OS detection, or advanced probing).
2. nmap

The Nmap tool itself ‚Äî used for network discovery and security auditing.
3. 10.10.154.18

The target IP address you‚Äôre scanning.
This could be a host in a TryHackMe, Hack The Box, or lab environment.
4. -oN nmap

    -oN ‚Üí Output in normal format (readable text).

    nmap ‚Üí File name to save the results to.
    üìÑ This means your scan results will be stored in a file called nmap in the current directory.

5. -sC

Runs Nmap‚Äôs default scripts (--script=default).

    These are part of NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine).

    They check for common vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and gather extra service info.

6. -sV

Enables service version detection.

    Attempts to identify the software and version running on each open port.
### explaining the output

    PORT ‚Äî port number and protocol (e.g. 22/tcp = TCP port 22).

    STATE ‚Äî whether the port is open, closed, filtered, etc. open means a service is listening and responding.

    SERVICE ‚Äî the common name for the service nmap thinks runs there (e.g. ssh, http-alt).

    REASON ‚Äî how nmap determined the state (e.g. syn-ack means the remote host replied to our TCP SYN with SYN-ACK).

    VERSION ‚Äî nmap‚Äôs guess at the software and version running on that port (banner/service fingerprinting).

Port 1 ‚Äî 22/tcp open ssh syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu ...

Breakdown:

    22/tcp ‚Äî TCP port 22 (standard SSH port).

    open ‚Äî SSH is accepting connections.

    ssh ‚Äî nmap identifies the service as SSH.

    syn-ack ttl 63 ‚Äî nmap sent a SYN and the host replied with SYN-ACK; TTL (time-to-live) 63 is the value in the reply (gives a tiny hint about OS/hops ‚Äî many Linux boxes start at 64 so 63 often means one hop less). Don‚Äôt rely on TTL alone for OS detection.

    OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.13 ‚Äî the SSH server banner: OpenSSH version 8.2p1 on an Ubuntu package. This leaks useful info (what software and version is running).
    | (pipe) lines = script output. |_ marks the end of that block.

    ssh-hostkey: ‚Äî nmap pulled the server‚Äôs public host keys (what the server uses to prove its identity).

    Each key line shows:

        key size (e.g. 3072 bits for RSA),

        fingerprint (hex groups like 0c:9b:...) ‚Äî a short representation you can compare to detect changes (if a host key changes unexpectedly it could be a security issue or MITM),

        the algorithm (RSA, ECDSA, ED25519).

    The long AAAAB3NzaC1... string is the server‚Äôs public key in base64 form. It‚Äôs normal; clients store a fingerprint in ~/.ssh/known_hosts to remember servers.

What to take away: SSH is up and giving a normal banner + host keys. That‚Äôs useful for connecting (if authorized) and for detecting host-key changes later.\

Port 2 ‚Äî 8000/tcp open http-alt syn-ack ttl 63 SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2\

<img width="609" height="436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d928c887-c084-48bc-ad69-80f6ffb6430a" />\

Breakdown:

    8000/tcp ‚Äî TCP port 8000 (commonly used for dev web servers or alternate HTTP).

    open ‚Äî an HTTP-like service is listening.

    http-alt ‚Äî nmap‚Äôs name for an alternate HTTP port.

    SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2 ‚Äî the server header: this looks like Python‚Äôs simple HTTP server (a small built-in HTTP server), running under Python 3.11.2.

Script and detection output under 8000

|_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests
|_http-server-header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html; charset=utf-8).
|_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: FBD3...
| http-methods:
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
| fingerprint-strings: 
|   ... various probe responses ...

Explain each:

    http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests
    Nmap‚Äôs proxy-check script suspects the server may act like a proxy (i.e., it could forward requests to other sites). This could be a valid behavior or a false positive ‚Äî verify manually. An open proxy can be abused if exposed to the public.

    http-server-header ‚Äî repeats the Server: header sent by the web service. This leaks product/version info (useful for attackers to look up known vulnerabilities).

    http-title: Site doesn't have a title ‚Äî the HTML page returned had no <title> tag. Not important security-wise, but a hint about page content (maybe directory listing or minimal page).

    http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: ‚Äî nmap hashed the site‚Äôs favicon and prints the MD5; this helps fingerprinting known apps (some tools/databases match favicon hashes to web apps).

    http-methods: Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS ‚Äî lists HTTP methods the server accepts:

        GET ‚Äî fetch a resource (normal reading),

        HEAD ‚Äî fetch headers only,

        POST ‚Äî send data (forms, APIs),

        OPTIONS ‚Äî ask the server what methods are allowed.
        Missing PUT/DELETE often means less risk of remote file modification, but don‚Äôt assume.

    fingerprint-strings ‚Äî nmap tries many different probes (like simulating weird or non-HTTP traffic) to see how the service reacts. The quoted responses (e.g. invalid syntax (<string>, line 1) or name 'GET' is not defined) are strings the server returned when fed those probes.

        Those responses look like Python error messages ‚Äî which matches the SimpleHTTP server identification. So nmap matched those unique responses to identify the server type.

Small notes on syn-ack ttl 63

    syn-ack = positive TCP handshake reply (so port is definitely open).

    ttl 63 is the TTL value the remote host used in its reply. Common starting TTLs are 64/128/255; seeing 63 often means the host started at 64 and it decremented once on the path. TTL can give a very rough hint of OS or number of network hops, but it‚Äôs not definitive.
### next advisable step
***check the http header title***  
curl -I http://10.10.204.34:8000  

curl -v http://10.10.204.34:8000/


# STEP 2 
type 
```10.10.204.34:8000```\

then ***netcat***
```sudo nc 10.10.204.34 8000 -v```\

The name of the room gave us already a hint that python would be included to some degree. This confirms it. We can execute Python code. Trying some commands resulted in enumerating the system with basically those two commands:
``` print(os.listdir('/'))```\
``` print(open('/filename', 'r').read()) ```\
#### the explanation of the codes.
firstline\

    print(os.listdir('/'))
    os.listdir(path) ‚Üí Lists all files and directories in the given path.
    Here the path is '/' ‚Äî the root directory in a Linux/Unix file system (kind of like ‚ÄúC:\‚Äù in Windows).
    So os.listdir('/') returns something like:
    ['bin', 'boot', 'dev', 'etc', 'home', 'lib', ...]
    print(...) just outputs that list to the console.\
<img width="614" height="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d97ed7-bb67-4ab0-b6a5-fcfd52118310" />\

Second line: **we can do best and be checking through each dir. to know the files in each of them to know what we are up to**

    print(open('/filename', 'r').read())
    open(path, 'r') ‚Üí Opens the file located at / <filename> in read mode ('r').\ filename of any of the above dir.
    .read() ‚Üí Reads the entire file contents into memory.
    print(...) ‚Üí Prints that content to the console.\

*** had to check each dir oen-by-one to know which one we can start with***\
<img width="622" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b20f810-3deb-44fe-8b3f-db44ef04af80" />\
/home is a dead end as it need permission.
so\
let's use var.\

so , we found a e-mail in (/var/mail/think) ___ but there was nothing in (/var/mail/www-data) as it was empty.  
#### let's continue to check the directories we might find some other useful stuffs.
checking back on the email the letter was written by root_user.\
