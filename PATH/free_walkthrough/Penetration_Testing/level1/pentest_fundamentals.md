# TASK 1: WHAT IS PEN TEST ?

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

# TASK 2: PENETRATION TESTING ETHICS.
Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on. This discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.\
Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal, it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.

Penetration testers will often be faced with potentially morally questionable decisions during a penetration test. For example, they are gaining access to a database and being presented with potentially sensitive data. Or they are, perhaps, performing a phishing attack on an employee to test an organisation's human security. If that action has been agreed upon during the initial stages, it is legal -- however ethically questionable.

### Hackers are sorted into three hats, where their ethics and motivations behind their actions determine what hat category they are placed into. Let's cover these three in the table below:
#### White Hat -	These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.
#### Grey Hat -	These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.
#### Grey Hat -	These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.

### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document which you can view online here.

**Permission** - This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.\
**Test Scope** - This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.\
**Rules** - The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.
# TASK 3:  PENETRATION TESTING METHODOLOGIES.
The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the methodology.\
A practical methodology is a smart one, where the steps taken are relevant to the situation at hand.

Penetration tests can have a wide variety of objectives and targets within scope. Because of this, no penetration test is the same, and there are no one-case fits all as to how a penetration tester should approach it. 

**Information Gathering	:** This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.
Note: This does not involve scanning any systems.  
**Enumeration/Scanning :** This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.  
**Exploitation :** This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.  
**Privilege Escalation	:** Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).  
**Post-exploitation	:** This stage involves a few sub-stages:
1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user
3.  Covering your tracks
4. Reporting

# TASK 4: Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration Testing
There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. Your understanding of your target will determine the level of testing that you perform in your penetration testing engagement. In this task, we'll cover these three different scopes of testing.

#### Black-Box Testing
This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software. This testing can involve interacting with the interface, i.e. buttons, and testing to see whether the intended result is returned. No knowledge of programming or understanding of the programme is necessary for this type of testing.
Black-Box testing significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.

#### Grey-Box Testing
This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes. The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.
With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

#### White-Box Testing
This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.
The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.
