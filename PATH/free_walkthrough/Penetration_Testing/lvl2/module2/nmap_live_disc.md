When we want to target a network, we want to find an efficient tool to help us handle repetitive tasks and answer the following questions:  
    Which systems are up?  
    What services are running on these systems?  

We present the different approaches that Nmap uses to discover live hosts. In particular, we cover:  
    ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts  
    ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts  
    TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.  

We also introduce two scanners, arp-scan and masscan, and explain how they overlap with part of Nmapâ€™s host discovery.

# TASK 2 : subnet
A network segment is a group of computers connected using a shared medium. For instance, the medium can be the Ethernet switch or WiFi access point.The network segment refers to a physical connection, while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.  

If you are connected to the same subnet, you would expect your scanner to rely on ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) queries to discover live hosts , If you are in Network A, you can use ARP only to discover the devices within that subnet (10.1.100.0/24)...  
 Suppose you are connected to a subnet different from the subnet of the target system(s). In that case, all packets generated by your scanner will be routed via the default gateway (router) to reach the systems on another subnet.
