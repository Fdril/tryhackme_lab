## my path  / my roadmap to follow.
🛤️ PHASE 1: Foundations (Grounding Your Core Skills)

Even hackers need strong basics. Don’t skip this.
🔹 1. Computer Networking (Master this)

    Understand TCP/IP, ports, protocols, DNS, routing, etc.

    Cybrary: “CompTIA Network+”

    Free Alternative: Professor Messer Network+

    Labs: Use TryHackMe - “Network Fundamentals”

🔹 2. Linux Essentials

    Most tools run on Linux. You’ll need command line fluency.

    Platform: Cybrary’s “Intro to Linux”

    Hands-On: Use a VM (like Kali or Ubuntu) or TryHackMe’s "Linux Fundamentals"

    Practice: Navigate, edit files, use grep, awk, netstat, ss, etc.

🔹 3. Cybersecurity Concepts

    Build a vocabulary: CIA Triad, Threats, Vulnerabilities, Risk, Exploits.

    Course: Cybrary “Introduction to Cybersecurity”

    Book (Optional): "Cybersecurity for Beginners" – Raef Meeuwisse

🛠️ PHASE 2: Start Hacking (Ethical Hacking & Tools)
🔹 4. Ethical Hacking Basics

    Begin learning how hackers think & work.

    Core Course: Cybrary's “Ethical Hacking” or TryHackMe’s “Pre-Security” and “Junior Penetration Tester” path

    Supplement: The book “The Hacker Playbook v3” or “Penetration Testing” by Georgia Weidman

🔹 5. Tools & Methodologies

Start exploring the offensive tools.
Tool	Learn Purpose
Nmap	Network scanning, enumeration
Burp Suite	Web app testing
Nikto / Gobuster	Directory brute-forcing
Metasploit	Exploitation framework
Wireshark	Packet capture and analysis

👉 Use TryHackMe’s Offensive Pentesting Path
🚩 PHASE 3: Real-World Practice (Practical Labs)
🔹 6. Capture the Flag (CTF) & Labs

Practice every day if possible. Build muscle memory.

    Platforms:

        Hack The Box Academy

        TryHackMe

        CyberSecLabs

    Start with beginner rooms:

        TryHackMe: “Mr Robot”, “OWASP Top 10”

        HTB: “Lame”, “Blue”, “Netmon”

🎯 PHASE 4: Cert-Focused Track (Optional but Strategic)

Once you’re confident:

    eJPT (INE / OffSec) – Beginner pentester cert

    CompTIA Security+ – For cybersecurity fundamentals (optional)

    PNPT – Practical, no multiple-choice

    OSCP (long-term goal)

💡 Extra Advice from Successful Hackers

    Document your learning (use a personal GitHub or blog)

    Join communities (Reddit r/HowToHack, InfoSec Twitter, Discord)

    Do personal projects (build a vulnerable web app or a simple malware in a sandbox)

    Fail often — but learn always.
